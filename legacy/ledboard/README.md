ledboard is as the name implies. A board for driving LED's. It was influcended by IKEA's LED strip that useage Alkine battery. Even though LED's are power effiecent it's still a waste of material of needing to replace these batteries.
That's why this ledboard has support to use either lithium ion battery for portability or via USB.
